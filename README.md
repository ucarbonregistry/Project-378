The proposed project activity with title under UCR “Small Scale Wind Power Project in Kutch District”
(Herein after called as project proponent ‘PP’) in Gujarat is a grid-connected renewable power
generation activity which incorporates installation and operation of one Wind Turbine Generator
(WTG) having capacity 2.1 MW, manufactured and supplied by Suzlon Energy in the Gujarat State in
India. The project is an operational activity with continuous reduction of GHG, currently being applied
under “Universal Carbon Registry” (UCR).

The project activity is a renewable power generation activity which incorporates installation and
operation of single Wind Turbine Generator (WTG) having capacity of 2.1 MW manufactured and
supplied by Suzlon Energy respectively in district Kutch of the state of Gujarat in India. This project
has been promoted by M/s RB Industries.

The project activity aims to harness the kinetic energy of wind (a renewable source) to generate
electricity. Wheeling agreement is signed between Dakshin Gujarat Vij Company Ltd. (DGVCL) and
PP. The project activity has been helping in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction by using
renewable resources (wind energy) for generating power which otherwise would have been generated
using grid mix power plants, which is dominated by fossil fuel based thermal powerplants. Currently,
the NEWNE grid is connected to large numbers of fossil fuel-based power plants. Hence, project
activity is displacing the gross electricity generation i.e., 5738.655 MWh from the NEWNE grid, which
otherwise would have been imported from the NEWNE grid.
Since the project activity generates electricity through wind energy, a clean renewable energy source it
will not cause any negative impact on the environment and thereby contributes to climate change
mitigation efforts
